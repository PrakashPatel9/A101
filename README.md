Step-by-Step Instructions for Research Analysis
Step 1: Define the Research Question (Date: Before 18 Nov)
Research Question: How does an individual's job type affect the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit?
Step 2: State Hypotheses (Date: Before 18 Nov)
Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in the proportion of individuals subscribing to a term deposit (y) among different job types (job).
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a difference in the proportion of individuals subscribing to a term deposit (y) among different job types (job).





After running the test, report the following: 
- Chi-Square Statistic: 961.24
- p-value: 4.19e-199
Conclusion: The p-value is much smaller than the significance level (0.05). Therefore, reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that job type significantly affects the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.
